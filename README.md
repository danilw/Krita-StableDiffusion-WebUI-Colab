# Krita-StableDiffusion-WebUI-Colab

**What is it** - this is Colab script for https://github.com/Interpause/auto-sd-krita

### Tested 5 Feb 2023 - still work

# Important note:

- **This is _Colab Old Krita plugin_** and I do not have Colab setup for *new plugin* [new auto-sd-paint-ext](https://github.com/Interpause/auto-sd-paint-ext), go check new plugin page maybe there easy way to setup Colab.

- I recomend to **use** - **only default WebUI**, not this Krita plugin. **My** [**WebUI Colab script**](https://github.com/danilw/WebUI-Colab-AUTOMATIC1111-stable-diffusion-webui) - use this, Krita not needed, WebUI works from web-page.\
This Krita Colab and plugin may have some bugs and missed features that works on WebUI, and WebUI have more functional.\
*I keep this repository only because it still works, so maybe someone actually need it*.
